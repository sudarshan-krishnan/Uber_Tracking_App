## Scope

### Expansion to Bangalore, India

In addition to analyzing Uber pickups in New York City, we plan to expand the app's functionality to include data from Bangalore, India. This expansion will involve integrating with Uber's API and accessing relevant datasets to visualize and analyze Uber pickups in Bangalore.

### Optimization for Reduced Wait Times

With data from Bangalore incorporated into the app, we aim to optimize the allocation of cab drivers to reduce wait times for passengers. By analyzing historical booking times, traffic patterns, and demand fluctuations, we will identify areas and times of high demand to strategically position cab drivers, ensuring prompt availability for passengers during peak hours.

### Key Objectives:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain access to Uber's API and relevant datasets for Bangalore, India.
   
2. **Visualization and Analysis**: Implement features to visualize and analyze Uber pickups in Bangalore, including histograms, maps, and filters similar to those available for New York City data.

3. **Optimization Algorithms**: Develop algorithms to optimize the allocation of cab drivers based on historical booking times and demand patterns.

4. **User Interface Enhancements**: Enhance the user interface to accommodate the expansion to Bangalore, providing a seamless experience for users accessing data from both cities.

5. **Testing and Deployment**: Thoroughly test the expanded features and ensure compatibility with the existing functionality before deploying the updated version of the app.

By expanding the scope of the UberTracker web app to include Bangalore, India, and implementing optimization strategies based on recorded booking times, we aim to improve the efficiency of Uber services and enhance the overall experience for both passengers and drivers in the region.
